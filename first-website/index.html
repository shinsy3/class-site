    <p>The hand has become <em>increasingly</em> less present in the web as we know it today. <strong>Websites are automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few.</strong> <small>It has only gotten easier to learn and make on the web, but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject.</small> This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the hand-quality of websites by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the web. <br>We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space.</p>
