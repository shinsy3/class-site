    <h1>Memories of clover</h1>

    <p1>Everyone will have fond memories of wandering and squatting <br>for a long time under the shamrock as a child looking for a four-leaf clover.</p1><br><br>

    <p2>When the clover flowers start to bloom, I remember making flower rings and playing around <br>the field with my friends. Luckily if I found a four-leaf clover, I carefully placed it on a bookmark.</p2><br><br>

    <p3>Clovers can be found almost anywhere near the area with a lot of sunlight. <br>Although the country of origin is Europe, clovers are very adaptable <br>enough to spread to Oman except for the polar regions, jungles, and deserts.</p3><br><br>

    <p4><strong>The four leaves represent...</strong></p4>

    <ul><small>
      <li>Hope</li>
      <li>Faith</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>Luck</li>
    </small></ul>

    <p5>So why is this mutated four-leaf clover so-called a symbol of good fortune?</p5><br><br><br><br>

    <p6><blockquote><small>“If a man walking in the fields <br><br>find any four-leaved grass, <br><br>he shall in a small while <br><br>after find some good thing.” <br><br>
    <strong>-Sir John Melton 1620-</strong></small></blockquote></p6><br><br><br><br>

    <p7>Out of the many origins, the most famous four-leaf clover bringing good luck is <br>probably from the story of  Napoleon Bonaparte. When Napoleon suddenly bent down <br>to pick the four-leaf clover, a bullet passed over his head and saved his life. Since then, <br>many have believed that a four-leaf clover had a symbol of good luck.</p7><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p8>When I walk along the road and see a bunch of clovers, I still take a quick glance and try to <br>find the hidden four-leaf clover among the countless three-leaf clovers.</p8><br><br>

    <p9>Lastly, the combined three-leaf clover we are familiar with means 'happiness'. <br>A four-leaf clover means 'lucky,’ but in fact, I believe that the reason we can see <br>more three-leaf clovers is that there is big and small happiness around us like a three-leaf clover in our everyday life...</p9><br><br>
