    <p class="p1">Everyone will have fond memories <br>of wanderig and squatting <br>for a long time under the shamrock <br>as a child looking for a four-leaf clover.</p><br><br>

    <p class="p2">When the clover flowers start to bloom, <br>I remember making flower rings <br>and playing around the field with my friends. <br>Luckily if I found a four-leaf clover, <br>I carefully placed it on a bookmark.</p><br><br>

    <br><br><br><br>

    <p class="p3">Clovers can be found almost anywhere <br>near the area with a lot of sunlight. <br>Although the country of origin is Europe, <br>clovers are very adaptable enough to <br>spread to Oman except for the polar <br>regions, jungles, and deserts.</p><br><br>

    <p class="p4"><strong>The four leaves represent...</strong></p>

    <ul><small>
      <li>~ Hope</li>
      <li>~ Faith</li>
      <li>~ Love</li>
      <li>~ Luck</li>
    </small></ul>


    <p class="p5">So why is this mutated four-leaf <br>clover so-called a symbol of good fortune?</p><br><br><br><br>

    <p class="p6"><strong>“If a man walking in the fields <br><br>find any four-leaved grass, <br><br>he shall in a small while <br><br>after find some good thing.”</strong></p><br>


    <p class="p6-5"><small>-Sir John Melton, 1620-</small></strong></p><br><br><br><br>

    <p class="p7">Out of the many origins, the most <br>famous four-leaf clover bringing <br> good luck is probably from <br>the story of  <em>Napoleon Bonaparte.</em> <br>When Napoleon suddenly bent down <br>to pick the four-leaf clover, <br>a bullet passed over his <br>head and saved his life. Since then, <br>many have believed that a four-leaf <br>clover had a symbol of good luck.</p><br><br><br><br>

    <br><br>

    <p class="p8">When I walk along the road <br>and see a bunch of clovers, <br>I still take a quick glance and <br>try to find the hidden four-leaf clover <br>among the countless three-leaf clovers.</p><br><br>

    <p class="p9">Lastly, the combined three-leaf <br>clover we are familiar with means <br>'happiness'. A four-leaf clover <br>means 'lucky,’ but in fact, <br>I believe that the reason we can see <br>more three-leaf clovers is <br>that there is big and small <br>happiness around us like a <br>three-leaf clover in our everyday life...</p><br><br><br>
