        A Handmade Web-J.R. Carpenter</p><hr>

        <p class="p1"><em>“Living Web”</em></em></p>

        <p class="tn">Takeaway:</p>

        <p class="takeaway">
        ✴&#xFE0E; I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind.<br>

        ✴&#xFE0E; A Vernacular Web (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as: “It was a web of sudden connections and personal links.”<br>

        ✴&#xFE0E; In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011) Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively generates sensual and informational presence."<br></p>

        <p class="tn">Note:</p>

        <p class="note">
        In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding The Great Web 1.0 Revival. Its author Kyle Chayka observed: The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer, and more intimate. We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where everything was smaller…</p>

        ╰ Now our digital world seems to be not secure anymore as it gets more complex and intense.</p>

        <p class="note">
        Handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web</p>

        <p class="comment">
        ╰ The invention of new devices containing programmed tools allows people to create a website much more easily than before when a hand-made website is starting to become forgotten.</p>

          A Rant About "Technology"- Ursula K. Le Guin's</p><hr>

        <p class="link">
        <a href="http://ursulakleguinarchive.com/Note-Technology.html">Reading link</a></p>

        <p class="tn">Takeaway: </p>

        <p class="takeaway">
        ✴&#xFE0E; How can genuine science fiction of any kind lack technological content?<br>

        ✴&#xFE0E; How can anybody make a story about a future or an alien culture without describing, implicitly or explicitly, its technology?<br></p>

        <p class="tn">Note:</p>

        <p class="note">
        Its technology is how a society copes with physical reality: how people get and keep and cook food, how they clothe themselves, what their power sources are (animal? human? water? wind? electricity? other?) what they build with and what they build, their medicine.</p>

        <p class="comment">
        ╰ Technology is everywhere in our daily lives, but we don’t normally recognize it and take it for granted. How are clothes made? How is the water that we drink produced? What is electricity made of? First of all, we don't question ourselves with these little simplest things in our lives.</p>

        <p class="note">
        "Technology" and "hi tech" are not synonymous, and a technology that isn't "hi," isn't necessarily "low" in any meaningful sense.</p>

        <p class="comment">
        ╰ Whether technology is high or low, both have their own important roles. Because one is considered low-tech doesn't mean they are less valuable than hi-tech.</p>

        <p class="note">
        “Technology is the active human interface with the material world.”</p>

        <p class="comment">
        ╰ Technology comes from the basics from natural to human resources to man-made objects.</p>

      My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?-Laurel Schwulst</p><hr>

      <p class="tn">Takeaway: </p>

      <p class="takeaway">
      ✴&#xFE0E; A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A server is a computer that’s always connected to the internet, so that when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website.<br>

      ✴&#xFE0E; Today more than ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future.<br>

      ✴&#xFE0E; This web needs to actually work for people instead of being powered by a small handful of big corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.<br>

      ✴&#xFE0E; In an age of information overload and an increasingly commercialized web, artists of all types are the people to help. Artists can think expansively about what a website can be. Each artist should create their own space on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective ambition.<br></p>

      <p class="tn">Note:</p>

      <p class="note">
      It makes perfect sense, then, when individuals tell me they want their website to do the job of “setting the record straight” on who they are and what they do.</p>

      <p class="comment">
      ╰ I believe that these days, people tend to create a website trying to do better or surpass another commercialized website like a competition instead of creating a website that they are passionate about. And importantly, they have less interest in learning the real beauty of what a hand-made website is.</p>

      <p class="note">
      Website is not just about showing it to others of its looks. But, we should also be thinking more about what this website means to you? It can be your diary, your hidden room, community, personal archive, etc.. (more interactive)</p>

      <p class="comment">
      ╰ What can a website be?
      →Website as room
      →Website as shelf
      →Website as plant
      →Website as garden
      →Website as puddle
      →Website as thrown rock that’s now falling deep into the ocean
      →The web is what we make it
